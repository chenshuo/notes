## Bandgap voltage reference

See "How a bandgap reference works" section in <https://www.righto.com/2014/09/reverse-engineering-counterfeit-7805.html>

The thermal voltage \(V_\mathrm{T} = \dfrac{kT}{q}\) is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT). \(V_\mathrm{T} \approx 25.8\mathrm{mV}\) at room temperature (27°C, or 300K).

> Ref. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant#The_thermal_voltage>

\(V_\mathrm{T}\) has a positive temperature coefficient of about 86.2μV/°C.

> \(\dfrac{V_\mathrm{T}}{T} = \dfrac{k}{q} = \dfrac{ 1.380649\times 10^{-23}}{1.602176634\times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.62 \times 10^{-5}\mathrm{V/K}\)

Therefore, we usually need \(10\ln 10 \cdot V_\mathrm{T}\approx 23V_\mathrm{T}\) to cancel out the tempco of one \(V_\mathrm{BE}\), which normally has a negative tempco about -2mV/°C.

> \(10 \ln 10 \times 86.2 \approx 23 \times 86.2 = 1.983\mathrm{mV/°C}\)

The actual tempco of \(V_\mathrm{BE}\) is related to \(V_\mathrm{BE}\) itself, its first order approximation is \(\dfrac{V_\mathrm{BE0} - V_\mathrm{g0}}{T_0}\), see formula in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_bandgap_temperature_sensor>

[Ebers–Moll model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor#Ebers%E2%80%93Moll_model):
\(I_\mathrm{E} \approx I_\mathrm{S}\exp \dfrac{V_\mathrm{BE}}{V_\mathrm{T}}\), equivalently
\(V_\mathrm{BE} = V_\mathrm{T}\ln \dfrac{I_\mathrm{E}}{I_\mathrm{S}}\).

[Reverse saturation current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_current) \(I_\mathrm{S}\) is directly proportional to the emitter-base junction area of a transistor, which we just call the *area* of the transistor.

If we set different emitter currents of two transistors,
we will get two different \(V_\mathrm{BE}\),
their difference is called \(\Delta V_\mathrm{BE}\),
\(\Delta V_\mathrm{BE} = V_\mathrm{T}\ln\dfrac{J_1}{J_2}\).
\(J\) is current density, directly proportional to emitter current \(I_\mathrm{E}\),
 inversely proportional to its area.

## The internal schematic

![TL431](media/tl431a.png)

Resistor values are taken from official TI datasheet <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tl431.pdf>.

The resistor and transistor numbering follows [SPICE model by Eugene Dvoskin](https://www.audio-perfection.com/voltage-regulators/linear-regulators/accurate-tl431-model-development-analysis-and-evaluation/).

Transistor \(Q_{11}\) is drawn in dashed lines, as it is off in normal operation mode.
IIUC, it acts like a diode to shutdown the output when `Ref` is connected to `Anode`.

## Analysis

Ignoring base currents, assuming \(\beta\gg 1\).
As we will see in the next section , we can actually estimate that \(\beta\approx 120\).

For the following analysis, we assume area ratio of \(Q_6:Q_2:Q_3\) being \(1:3:6\), taken from [The TL431 in loop control](https://powersimtof.com/Downloads/Papers/The%20TL431%20in%20loop%20control.pdf) by Christophe Basso.
Eugene Dvoskin's SPICE model (at the end of this page) uses a different ratio (\(0.5:1.2:2.2\)) though.

1. There are 11 transistors in total, \(Q_{11}\) is normally off, so we need to analyze 10 BJTs only.
1. It's easy to see that \(Q_9\) and \(Q_{10}\) form a Darlinton pair, it's the output stage.
1. It's also easy to recognize that \(Q_7\) and \(Q_8\) is a [current mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_mirror), if we assuming they have the same area. (In Ken Shirriff's schematic below, their areas are different, though.)
1. The rest of 6 transistors \(Q_1\dots Q_6\) are tangled together, let's analyze them in parts.

**Notation**:

* \(V_\mathrm{BE1}\) denotes the Base-Emitter junction voltage of transistor \(Q_1\)
* \(V_\mathrm{Q2B}\) denotes the base voltage of transistor \(Q_2\).
* \(V_\mathrm{Q3E}\) denotes the emitter voltage of transistor \(Q_3\), which is also known as \(\Delta V_\mathrm{BE}\).
* It's obvious from the schematic above, \(V_\mathrm{Q3C} = V_\mathrm{Q5B}\).
* \(I_\mathrm{B6}\) denotes the base current of transistor \(Q_6\), which equals to currents on \(R_6\), \(I_\mathrm{R6}\).
* \(V_\mathrm{R3}\) denotes the voltage across resistor \(R_3\), which is \(9 \Delta V_\mathrm{BE}\), assuming \(I_\mathrm{C3}\approx I_\mathrm{E3}\).
* \(I_2\), \(I_3\), \(I_1\) are currents on \(R_2\), \(R_3\), \(R_4\), respectively, \(I_1 = I_2 + I_3\) as shown in the full schematic above.
* Ignoring base currents, \(I_2 = I_\mathrm{C2} =  I_\mathrm{E2}\), \(I_3 = I_\mathrm{C3} =  I_\mathrm{E3}\), \(I_1 = I_\mathrm{C1} =  I_\mathrm{E1}\).

## Calculation

### Reference voltage

The reference voltage can be divided into 4 segments, from base of \(Q_1\) to ground: \(V_\mathrm{REF} = V_\mathrm{BE1} + V_\mathrm{R4} + V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{BE5}\).

**First**, we consider \(Q_2, Q_3\) and resistors connected to them, it's easy to find \(I_2 = 3I_3\).

1. Assuming \(V_\mathrm{BE2}=V_\mathrm{BE5}\approx 0.65\mathrm{V}\),
\(V_\mathrm{R2}=V_\mathrm{R3}\).

2. \(I_2 R_2 = I_3 R_3\), so \(I_2 = \dfrac{R_3}{R_2}I_3 = 3I_3\).
3. \(\Delta V_\mathrm{BE} = V_\mathrm{BE2} -V_\mathrm{BE3} = V_\mathrm{T}\ln 6\approx 46.3\)mV, given that the area of \(Q_3\) is \(2\times\) of \(Q_2\).
4. \(V_\mathrm{R3} = \dfrac{R_3}{R_1}\Delta V_\mathrm{BE} = 9\Delta V_\mathrm{BE}\), assuming \(I_\mathrm{C3}\approx I_\mathrm{E3}\).
5. The current on \(R_4\) is \(I_1 = I_2 + I_3 = 4I_3\), so \(V_\mathrm{R4} = \dfrac{4 R_4}{R_1}\Delta V_\mathrm{BE} = 16.4\Delta V_\mathrm{BE}\)
6. Sum of voltages across \(R_3\) and \(R_4\) is \(V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{R4} = (9+16.4) \Delta V_\mathrm{BE} = 25.4\Delta V_\mathrm{BE}=25.4\ln 6 V_\mathrm{T}\approx 45.5 V_\mathrm{T}\approx 1.174\)V.
7. Tempco of \(V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{R4}\) is \(45.5 \times 86.2\) = 3.922 mV/°C, canceling out negative tempco of \(V_\mathrm{BE1} + V_\mathrm{BE5}\), which is \(\dfrac{V_\mathrm{BE1} - V_\mathrm{g0}}{T_0} +\dfrac{V_\mathrm{BE5} - V_\mathrm{g0}}{T_0}\)
8. In theory, \(V_\mathrm{REF} = 2V_\mathrm{g0}\) when its tempco is zero.

\(R_4\) is critical, it controls both \(V_\mathrm{REF}\) and its tempco, I guess that's why it shows 3 decimal places in the datasheet (3.28kΩ), while other resistors has only 2.

![TL431](media/tl431dc1.png)

Estimating \(\beta\) for fun. It's rough estimation, so we use rounded values, like 1.2V, instead of 1.174V for  \(V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{R4}\).

1. Assuming \(V_\mathrm{BE1}=V_\mathrm{BE5}=0.65\)V for now.
2. Sum of voltages across \(R_3\) and \(R_4\) is \(V_\mathrm{REF} - V_\mathrm{BE1}-V_\mathrm{BE5} = 2.5-2\times 0.65 = 1.2\mathrm{V}\)
3. The total resistance across the aforementioned 1.2V is \(R_4 + R_2/\!/R_3 = 3.2 + 2.4 /\!/ 7.2 = 3.2+1.8 = 5\)kΩ
4. The current on \(R_4\) is \(I_1 =  \dfrac{1.2}{5} = 0.24\)mA, so
\(I_\mathrm{E1} = 240\)μA,
5. The current on \(R_4\) is \(I_1 = I_2 + I_3 = 4I_3\), so \(I_3 = I_1/4 = 60\)μA, and \(I_2 = 3I_3 = 180\)μA.
6. The datasheet says typical \(I_\mathrm{REF}=I_\mathrm{B1}=2\)μA, so we estimate \(\beta + 1 = I_{E1}/I_\mathrm{B1} = 240/2 = 120\).

The voltages and currents shown in above schematic are from SPICE simulation.

### Error amplifier

**Second**, we add \(Q_4\dots Q_8\) into the picture, omitting \(Q_9\) and \(Q_{10}\) for now.

It's safe to assume that all \(Q_4\dots Q_8\) share the same (emitter) current, because \(Q_7\) and \(Q_8\) form a current mirror, and it sets the currents of \(Q_4\), \(Q_5\), and \(Q_6\) to be all the same.

We will show that the current is 60μA for \(Q_4\dots Q_8\), same as emitter current of \(Q_3\).

1. \(V_\mathrm{Q2B} \approx V_\mathrm{Q6B}\), because \(I_\mathrm{B6}\) is less than 1μA, so voltage drop on \(R_6\) is less than 1mV.
2. Area of \(Q_6\) is 1E, area of \(Q_2\) is 3E, with the same base voltage, \(I_\mathrm{E2} = 3 I_\mathrm{E6}\)
3. We already knew that \(I_\mathrm{E2} = I_2 = 3I_3\), so \(I_3 = I_\mathrm{E6} = I_\mathrm{E3} = 60\)μA. In other words, \(Q_6\) has same current as \(Q_3\).
4. Due to current mirror made of \(Q_7\) and \(Q_8\), \(Q_4\) and \(Q_5\) mirrors the current of \(Q_6\). (But, see the note below.)
5. In conclusion, 6 transistors \(Q_3\dots Q_8\) all have the same current as \(Q_3\), when balanced, that is \(I_3=60\)μA.

Although this conclusion matches the simulation of the next section, there is an **unsolved puzzle**: the current mirror of \(Q_7\) and \(Q_8\) is supposed to copy \(Q_7\)'s current to \(Q_8\), but not vice versa.  However, the analysis above assume current of \(Q_6\), \(I_\mathrm{E6}\), is set by \(V_\mathrm{Q2B}\), then mirrored in \(Q_4\) and \(Q_5\).
Is this reasonable? My explanation is that the feedback of output stage will bring the circuit into the balanced state, where \(I_\mathrm{E4} = I_\mathrm{E6}\). (\(I_\mathrm{C6} = I_\mathrm{C8} - I_\mathrm{B9}\))

The following diagram shows what we have analyzed so far.

![TL431](media/tl431dc2.png)

The voltages and currents shown in above schematic are from SPICE simulation.

### Tempco

Recall that \(V_\mathrm{REF} = V_\mathrm{BE1} + V_\mathrm{R4} + V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{BE5} = 2.495\mathrm{V}\).


1. \(V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{R4} = (9+16.4) \Delta V_\mathrm{BE} = 25.4\Delta V_\mathrm{BE}=25.4\ln 6 V_\mathrm{T}\approx 45.5 V_\mathrm{T}\approx 1.174\mathrm{V}\)

1. \( V_\mathrm{BE1}  +  V_\mathrm{BE5}  = V_\mathrm{REF} - (V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{R4}) = 2.495 - 1.174 = 1.321\mathrm{V}\)

1. Tempco of \(V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{R4}\) is \(45.5 \times 86.2\) = 3.922 mV/°C

1. Tempco of \(V_\mathrm{BE1} + V_\mathrm{BE5}\) is \(\dfrac{V_\mathrm{BE1} - V_\mathrm{g0}}{T_0} +\dfrac{V_\mathrm{BE5} - V_\mathrm{g0}}{T_0} = \dfrac{V_\mathrm{BE1} + V_\mathrm{BE5} - 2V_\mathrm{g0}}{T_0} = \dfrac{1.321 - 2\times 1.205}{300}=-3.63\) mV/°C

1. Tempco of  \(V_\mathrm{REF} = 3.922 - 3.63 = +0.292\)mV/°C

From this calculation, we concluded that TL431's reference voltage will change 20.44mV when temperature changes from 0°C to 70°C. However TL431 datasheet says it will only change 4mV in this case, which is 5x better than our calculation.

I don't know how does TL431 archive such good tempco when \(V_\mathrm{REF} = 2.495\mathrm{V}\),
because tempco of \(V_\mathrm{REF}\) is determined only by itself: \(\dfrac{\mathrm{d} V_\mathrm{REF}}{\mathrm{d}\, T}=\dfrac{V_\mathrm{REF} -  2V_\mathrm{g0}}{T_0} = 0.085/300=0.283\)mV/°C.
Unless the chip manufacturer managed to change \(V_\mathrm{g0}\).


**Third**, let's calculate the required \(I_\mathrm{S}\), just for fun.

Recall that \(V_\mathrm{REF} = V_\mathrm{BE1} + V_\mathrm{R4} + V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{BE5} = 2.50\)V, in order to get \(V_\mathrm{R4} + V_\mathrm{R3} = 1.2\)V, we need \(V_\mathrm{BE1} + V_\mathrm{BE5} = 1.3\)V.

There are at least two ways to achieve that, given that \(I_\mathrm{E1} \approx 4 I_\mathrm{E5}\):

1. Area of \(Q_1\) is \(4\times\) of \(Q_5\), so \(V_\mathrm{BE1} = V_\mathrm{BE5} = 0.65\)V.
    * \(I_\mathrm{E5}=I_\mathrm{S}\exp\dfrac{V_\mathrm{BE5}}{V_\mathrm{T}}=60\)μA
    * \(I_\mathrm{S}\exp\dfrac{650}{25.8} = 60\times 10^{-6}\)
    * \(I_\mathrm{S} = 0.6865\)fA, this is for \(Q_5\)
    * for \(Q_1\), its \(I_\mathrm{S1} = 4 I_\mathrm{S} = 2.746\)fA.
2. Area of \(Q_1\) is the same as \(Q_5\),
so \(V_\mathrm{BE1} = V_\mathrm{BE5} + V_\mathrm{T}\ln 4\approx V_\mathrm{BE5}+35.8\)mV.
    * \(V_\mathrm{BE5} = (1300 - 35.8)/2 = 632\)mV, \(V_\mathrm{BE1} = 668\)mV
    * \(I_\mathrm{S}\exp\dfrac{632}{25.8} = 60\times 10^{-6}\)
    * \(I_\mathrm{S} = 1.379\)fA
    * for \(Q_1\), its \(I_\mathrm{S1} = I_\mathrm{S} = 1.379\)fA.

![TL431](media/tl431is2.png) second way to estimate \(I_\mathrm{S}\).

In the SPICE model, we set \(I_\mathrm{S} = 1.0\)fA for NPN transistors.

### Feedback

**Fourth**, the feedback loop.

\(Q_1\) is an emitter follower, \(Q_4\) and \(Q_6\) is differential pair, current mirror \(Q_7\) and \(Q_8\) serves as active load, the error amplifier output is collector of \(Q_8\), which feeds into base of \(Q_9\).

If \(V_\mathrm{REF}\) increases a tiny bit, we want to increase collector current of \(Q_{10}\) by a lot (a few mA per mV), to hopefully bring back \(V_\mathrm{REF}\) to its nominal value (2.495V) through the external feedback network (usually two resistors).

The following diagram shows what will happen if \(V_\mathrm{REF}\) increases by 1mV.

![TL431](media/tl431dc3.png)

Explanation:

1. \(V_\mathrm{REF}\uparrow\Rightarrow V_\mathrm{Q1B} \uparrow \Rightarrow V_\mathrm{Q1E} \uparrow \Rightarrow V_\mathrm{Q4B} \uparrow\)
1. \(I_\mathrm{C4} \propto \exp V_\mathrm{BE4}\)
1. As \(V_\mathrm{Q4B} \uparrow\), \(I_\mathrm{C4}\uparrow\), it drains more current from \(Q_7\). Because \(Q_8\) mirrors \(Q_7\), so \(I_\mathrm{C8}\uparrow\).
1. \(I_\mathrm{C2}\) is almost linear with \(V_\mathrm{Q1E} \), because \(V_\mathrm{Q2B}\propto \log I_\mathrm{C2}\).
1. \(Q_2\) and \(Q_6\) form a current source, \(I_\mathrm{C6} = \frac{1}{3}I_\mathrm{C2}\)
1. In short, \(\Delta I_\mathrm{C4} \propto \exp \Delta V_\mathrm{REF}\), while \(\Delta I_\mathrm{C6} \propto \Delta V_\mathrm{REF}\)
1. \(I_\mathrm{C6}\) only goes up linear with \(\Delta V_\mathrm{REF}\), much lower than \(\Delta I_\mathrm{C8}\), the increase of \(I_\mathrm{C8}\) mostly feeds into base of \(Q_9\).
1. \(\Delta I_\mathrm{B9}\) is amplified by \(Q_9\) and \(Q_{10}\), increase \(I_\mathrm{C10}\) a lot.
1. The increase of sink current will hopefully bring \(V_\mathrm{REF}\) down back.

**Dynamic Impedance**

If we sweep the bias current \(I_\mathrm{KA}\) from 1mA to 100mA,
   then measure the the output voltage \(V_\mathrm{out}\) range,
   we will get the output impedance of this circuit \(\dfrac{\Delta V_\mathrm{out}}{\Delta I_\mathrm{KA}}\approx\dfrac{14\mathrm{mV}}{100\mathrm{mA}}=0.14\Omega\).

It's 0.14Ω from simulation, lower than 0.2Ω as stated in the datasheet.

**DC Gain**

It's about 61dB from simulation, higher than 55dB as stated in TI's datasheet.

Here's brief analysis of its DC operating point, ignoring base currents.

1. Assuming \(V_\mathrm{BE4}\approx V_\mathrm{BE6}\approx 0.65\mathrm{V}\)
1. Voltage drops on \(R_2\) and \(R_3\) are approx the same. \(R_2 = R_3\) and \(V_\mathrm{R2}\approx V_\mathrm{R3}\), so \(I_2\approx I_3\).
1. The area ratio of \(Q_4\) and \(Q_5\) is \(0.9:7.2\), so voltage on \(R_4\) is \(\Delta V_\mathrm{BE} = V_\mathrm{T}\ln \dfrac{7.2}{0.9}= V_\mathrm{T}\ln 8\approx 53.6\mathrm{mV}\) at room temperature.

1. Assuming for \(Q_5\), its \(I_\mathrm{C5} = I_\mathrm{E5} = I_3\), so voltage on \(R_3\) is \(\dfrac{24}{3.4}\Delta V_\mathrm{BE}\)

1. Voltage on \(R_1\) is \(I_1 R_1 = 2 I_3 R_1 = 2 \dfrac{R_1}{R_4}\Delta V_\mathrm{BE} =\dfrac{2\times 25}{3.4} \Delta V_\mathrm{BE}\).

1. In total, \(V_\mathrm{REF} = V_\mathrm{BE6} + V_\mathrm{R3} + V_\mathrm{R1} + V_\mathrm{BE2} = \dfrac{2\times 25 + 24}{3.4} \Delta V_\mathrm{BE} + V_\mathrm{BE6}  + V_\mathrm{BE2} = \dfrac{74}{3.4} \Delta V_\mathrm{BE} + 2V_\mathrm{BE} \)

1. The PTAT portion \(\dfrac{74}{3.4} \Delta V_\mathrm{BE} = 21.765\times\ln 8 V_\mathrm{T} \approx 45.26  V_\mathrm{T}\), which should be in right amount to cancel tempco of two \(V_\mathrm{BE}\).

1. Assuming \(R_1 + R_2/\!/R_3 = 5\mathrm{kΩ}\),
so that \(I_\mathrm{R1}\approx 240\)μA. With \(I_\mathrm{REF} = 2\)μA, we have \(\beta = 120\).
    * \((25+\dfrac{24}{2})R=5000\), \(R = 135Ω\)
    * \(R_1=3.38\mathrm{kΩ}\)
    * \(R_2=R_3=3.24\mathrm{kΩ}\)
    * \(R_4=460\mathrm{Ω}\)

1. TODO: analyze the current mirror of gain 0.5, made of \(Q_8\) and \(Q_9\).
